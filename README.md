## Introduction

Continuous integration is a development practices that handles the integration of code to a shared repository. The common practice is for the developers to integrate their code several times a day to minimize the overhead of merging. Each integration is automatically verified by the continuous integration server that does an automated build and test. The server notifies the users of the result.

## Overview

This is a CI-server which should build and test files uploaded to a git-repository. The result of the build and tests gets sent as a email notification to the users of the repository.
